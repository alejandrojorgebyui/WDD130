        <p>I'm 34 years old. I got married with Rocio on September 2015 and by now we have 3 children:
        <ul>
            <li>Isabela (7yo)</li>
            <li>Rene (4yo)</li>
            <li>Alfonsina (6mo)</li>
        </ul>
        I serve a mission from 2011 to 2013 on Concepción, Chile. <br>
        Since I returned, I served as Stake Young Men President, Elders Quorum President,
        Counselor on the Bishopric and currently as Bishop.<br>

        I enjoy cooking, watching series, training in the gym, swimming, and playing with my kids.<br>
        I'm currently working as Data Analyst on a company called "Accenture"
